<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>What is AI?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A question that resonates more profoundly now than ever before. In our rapidly
evolving world, where AI is no longer just a futuristic concept but a present
reality, understanding its essence is crucial. This site aims to explore AI’s

their coding examples. This realization sparked the inception of L.E.A.R.N, a
platform meticulously designed to fill these educational voids. I aim to
transform complex theoretical concepts into accessible, layperson-friendly
explanations, enriched with comprehensive, practical examples and their
full-fledged source code. Understanding that my audience spans from eager
beginners to seasoned experts, L.E.A.R.N is carefully tailored to cater to
this spectrum. For novices, the site provides a gentle yet thorough
introduction to the world of AI, methodically building foundational knowledge.
Meanwhile, for the experienced, it offers in-depth analyses and advanced
