<p>I am thrilled to introduce you to my ambitious endeavor, L.E.A.R.N, <em>Learning
the Essence of AI, Research and Notations</em>. A comprehensive website dedicated
to unravel and demystify the true mechanics and the mathematics behind
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science. My mission with
this website is not merely to teach the implementation of specific AI
algorithms, but to delve into the very heart of mathematics that powers these
algorithms, thus providing a deeper understanding of <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> we
utilize these very specific mathematical models to solve diverse problems in
AI. The true motivation behind creating this website lies in the pursuit of
empowering learners, students, researchers, and practitioners with a profound
appreciation of the core principles behind AI. In the ever evolving landscape
of AI, where new research papers emerge literally <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent">everyday</a>,
establishing a robust foundational understanding becomes paramount to remain
abreast of emerging trends and advancements. As the author of this website,
I’m committed to explain the true mathematical reasoning behind every approach
related to AI. The website attempts to establish a strong correlation between
various concepts, offering an approachable and interconnected learning
experience. On a personal level, I believe that the journey of understanding
AI begins with the most fundamental questions – <em>Why do we employ specific
mathematical formulae, also known as models for particular problems, and why
not a single generic formula?</em></p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> Here, I will take a rather unique approach to explain each concept from
scratch, assuming no prior knowledge. Whether it is Statistics, Linear Algebra,
or other mathematical tools, I will dissect them comprehensively. I will also
delve into the historical contexts, the origins of these mathematical
frameworks, and their contributions to the field of AI. Through this, I hope
to create a space that bridges the gap between the history, theory and
practicality. Unlike other platforms that merely focus on teaching how to build
AI models, I will priortize developing a deep understanding of the mathematical
and scientific principles that govern AI. My belief is that once someone grasps
the essence of each mathematical technique, they can then apply their knowledge
to real-world problems with ease and confidence. One of the critical aspects I
will explore is the role of data in AI. I will emphasize why data is so
crucial, how it impacts an AI model’s efficiency, and how to collate and
utilize good datasets effectively. I will explain the trade-offs involved in
the learning process and how to make informed decisions while building AI based
solutions. The website will not only present the mathematical foundation but
also offer Python code equivalents for implementation. This hands-on approach
ensures that learners can experiment with the concepts they acquire, fostering
a deeper grasp of AI principles. As a graduate student currently employed at
<a class="reference external" href="https://communication.depaul.edu/Pages/default.aspx">DePaul University</a>, I have come across a
lot of brilliant students studying Photography, Videography and Journalism and
in the spirit of transparency and objectivity, I will showcase anecdotes from
these individuals who hold different perspectives on AI and Machine Learning.
I believe, my commitment to being utterly unbiased about my own field of
research encourages me to hone a holistic learning experience, addressing the
potential challenges that AI can present if not handled responsibly.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> Now, some of you might be thinking, <em>Why am I writing all of this on a
website, isn’t YouTube already enough?</em> And to answer this question, I would
like to introduce you to a concept called,
“<a class="reference external" href="https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/">The Feynman Technique</a>”. I would not go into
the details about the technique here as I prefer teaching things in more
practical way rather than explaining and letting the imagination run wild. So
maybe, I will go in-depth about <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Dr. Richard Feynman</a>’s
amazing technique about learning almost anything some other day in some other
topic. Now, coming back to the question – <em>Why write something?</em> Well, to
answer this question, I would like to provide some references to
<a class="reference external" href="https://nhigham.com">Prof. Nicholas Higham</a>’s 1998 classic book,
“<em>Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences</em>”. In the very first line
of he says, “<em>Writing helps you to learn</em>” and I truly believe this. He points
to an explanation by author Sheridan Baker. He says,</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>In writing, you clarify your own thoughts, and strengthen your
conviction. Indeed, you probably grasp your thoughts for the first time.
Writing is a way of thinking. Writing actually creates thought, and
generates your ability to think: you discover thoughts you hardly knew you
had, and come to know what you know. You learn as you write.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> I am not going to lie, the math behind these Machine Learning or AI
models is crazy and quite dense, but if you learn one thing properly at one
time, all of it will make sense when put together. But in order to get to that
stage, we need to understand how things work at the fundamental level – <em>Why
we do certain things the certain way? Why we need to carry out these steps
when we can jump onto some other step directly?</em> There are a lot of questions
that need a proper answering and to do that, writing and explaining them with
examples makes more sense. Plus, you as a reader can suggest things too! If
you feel that you have a better example to show and explain any particular
topic, feel free to raise a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/xames3/learn/pulls">PR</a> and I will have it merged. This
way, we all can learn together from eachother. As I had previously mentioned,
I don’t want to teach students or researchers what they should be doing in a
particular situation, rather I want them to understand the presented problem
at hand and the available resources at their disposal making sure they squeeze
the most of out of their potential. I will be honest with you, I have seen a
lot of students or beginners in AI or Data Science not able to excel enough in
their respective spectrum and mainly is because they don’t work with practical
examples or some real-life problems with seriously humongous data. And to
that, I do understand the conundrum that is presented before these students.
Finding a problem to solve is hard, let alone a real-life one. Even if you
manage to find a good problem statement to begin with, you are very unlikely
to find a decent dataset to play with. And this leads to poor understanding of
the concepts and lack of practice of these newly-learnt skills. Although, I am
not claiming to provide good datasets to try out things, what I am claiming
is, I can teach some workarounds to get around a miserably smaller dataset and
what can we do about it. Just because someone never got an opportunity to play
with sufficient data, it shouldn’t stop them from exploring and exploiting the
system without probing it with some faulty assumptions. We really need to
understand why large-scale data matters and how data makes a particular model
more better or efficient. We need to understand, “<em>What efficiency really
means in the world of AI? What makes an AI good or bad in terms of its output
quality?</em>”. These are some of the questions one must ask themselves before
starting to explore their ways with solving ML related problems.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> For some it may sound daunting or boring and too much work in the
beginning but as you keep doing it repeatedly, it will become a good habit and
pay off higher dividends. Thus, through L.E.A.R.N I invite you to embark on an
enlightening journey and I hope to unveil the history, science, and the maths
behind AI in an engaging manner. By understanding the historical references of
mathematical formulae, we can appreciate why they came into existence and how
they revolutionized the field of AI decades or centuries later. To conclude
this short introduction, this website seeks to empower individuals to
comprehend the essence of AI beyond its surface. Together, we embark on a
voyage that reveals the intricate reasonings behind AI, unveiling the beauty
and the brilliance that drives this transformative field.</p>
<p>If you read it completely, I would like to thank you for your time!</p>
