<p>Hello hello everyone! I am excited to introduce you to my latest and ambitious endeavour, L.E.A.R.N <span class="raw-html">&mdash;</span> <em>Learning the Essence of AI, Research and Notations</em>. It is a comprehensive yet beginner-friendly website dedicated to unravelling the mathematical reasonings behind AI, Machine Learning and Data Science. It is a place where I use my free time to teach the things related to this field I learnt, the hard way. This website explores the answer to the question, What is AI? As the author of this website, my goal is to help you understand AI, especially why it has been buzzing nowadays.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> Over the internet, there are many resources available related to Machine Learning and AI in the form of books or videos, but in my experience, most of them are either too complicated to understand or provide incomplete or dummy source code. What I have observed is these resources do not explain things properly in lay terms, this is the reason I decided to write this website. This website aims to present easy explanations of the subject with many practical examples and its respective source code. Whether you are a complete beginner or an expert in the field I am sure that you will find a lot of valuable information here. As a researcher, I have implemented a good amount of machine learning models and I want to explain my experiences with them and how I struggled in my initial days. I would like to take you on this journey with me on exploring the hidden realm of AI which is nothing but pure math! Here, you will learn the mathematical basis and approach behind these AI models.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> In the ever-evolving landscape of this field, new research papers are published every day on <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent">arXiv</a> (pronounced “<em>archive</em>”) and to keep up with the latest trends, establishing a robust foundational understanding becomes critical. I am committed to explaining the mathematical concepts behind various approaches related to machine learning on L.E.A.R.N. This website attempts to establish a strong correlation between various concepts, offering an approachable and interconnected learning experience.</p>

<section id="why-learn-about-ai">
<h2><span class="sectnum">2   </span>Why learn about AI?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-learn-about-ai" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>I am currently writing this in August of 2023, we are in the middle of an AI boom. Since 2010, AI has been <abbr title="present everywhere">ubiquitous</abbr> in our lives. You can hardly avoid hearing about it. It has become a significant part of our society whether we like it or not. With the accessibility of the internet in most of the world, interacting with AI at some level is almost unskippable. Most of us who have interacted with electronic or smart devices have used AI knowingly or unknowingly. It is a must in some industries like medicines, genomics, etc. to name a few. Majority of the human labour will continue to be transformed and will possibly be eliminated unfortunately by these AIs in the not-so-distance future. This technology is increasingly being used to manage huge parts of our society, whether be it in academic settings or the military. As portrayed in movies, the militaries all over the world use AIs to develop and prototype autonomous killing machines capable of causing mass destruction with little to no human effort. All these development, be they good or bad is currently happening as we speak and can pose a major threat to our society if not handled carefully.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> Companies like Google, Tesla, OpenAI, etc. are major players in this space and have developed profoundly amazing AI solutions. I am pretty sure you all know this. But have you ever wondered, Why an EV manufacturing company like Tesla is investing billions of dollars in building <em>self-driving</em> cars? or Why Google and OpenAI are battling for supremacy with their <em>Generative AI</em> solutions? It is quite simple, that is the future we are heading into. Governments, afraid of falling behind in the race are handing out lavish grants to many AI-based startups and research labs but still, that is not enough!</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> We know that Google is a pioneer in the AI space and has had a good headstart in this game. Their products and services are all powered by AI to some extent and are amazing, no doubt! But, sometimes even they feel inefficient or ineffective for some tasks. For example, imagine you are using Google Sheets for some data analysis work and you want to get data in some format for further processing. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to get tell Google Sheets what you want and how you can get it. Of course, the problem I am posing in this example is far more complicated than it seems like but it is a realistic scenario that a lot of us face at work. So is it fair to say that the underlying AI model empowering Google Sheets is not good? I feel it is harsh discriminating against this amazing technology. We, the end-users need to understand what this service is about and what it is capable of. Thus, knowing what kind of AI solution we are using at hand also plays a very important role.</p>

<section id="how-am-i-approaching-this">
<h2><span class="sectnum">3   </span>How am I approaching this?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-am-i-approaching-this" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>I admit that there are many resources available on the internet but, I still stand by the fact that I and most of the people I have talked to find them <abbr title="clumsy">clunky</abbr> and difficult to understand. The true motivation behind creating a website like this lies in the pursuit of empowering readers with the fundamental knowledge of using mathematical tools at your disposal. My goal here is to make you, the readers aware of these AIs and how to build them correctly. The term “<em>correctly</em>” is used subjectively here. I see AI to be nothing but a huge mathematical mess and like any mathematical problem, there is no “one” solution to solve it. We can perform a set of different steps and still get the same answer but AI ain’t simple. To understand it correctly, we need to understand the basis of its model and by that, I mean how to derive the formula or debunk the equation. If we can understand how to reverse-engineer this formula, we can build our own AI model. But it is far easier said than done. This is where L.E.A.R.N’s easy understanding comes in handy.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> I am taking a unique approach to explaining each concept from scratch, assuming no prior knowledge from the readers whatsoever. For some of you, it may feel too easy and incredibly slow-paced but the complexity of the topic will escalate quickly before you even know it. Although I have taught software engineering to students and developers I have not ventured into mathematics so it is a new experience for me. I am going to use the teaching style of one of my college professors, Dr Marcus Schaefer whom I deeply admire. I find his teaching approach to be quite simple and rather very effective. He would give us a historical context about the mathematician or the philosopher who established the formula or concept respectively. Later he would make remarks on how we use their work for solving complicated problems in our day-to-day life. During classes, I used to find it very fascinating how something so old is still very relevant today and that is what we need to understand.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> I will use a lot of examples to solve the same problem. The goal here is to build a strong understanding of the subject. At the end of each topic, we will experiment with different scenarios like <abbr title="changing signs">conjugation</abbr>, changing the order of operation, etc. This will allow us to understand how the variables behave under different circumstances. Whether it is Statistics, Linear Algebra, or another mathematical <abbr title="concept">paradigm</abbr>, I will dissect it comprehensively. I will prioritise developing a profound understanding of the mathematical and scientific principles which govern these models. I believe that once someone grasps the essence of mathematical techniques, they can then apply their knowledge to real-world problems with confidence.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> Here, I will not only present the mathematical explanations but the respective <a class="reference external" href="https://python.org">Python</a> code for implementation. This hands-on approach ensures the readers experiment with the concepts they acquire, fostering a deeper grasp of mathematics using computer science. Currently, I am pursuing my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at DePaul University. While being here, I have come across a lot of amazing students from different majors and staff members who have contrasting opinions about AI. In the spirit of transparency and objectivity, I will highlight anecdotes from these individuals who hold different perspectives on technology than the rest of us. I believe my commitment to being utterly unbiased about my field of research encourages me to hone a holistic learning experience, addressing the potential challenges AI can present if not handled responsibly.</p>

<section id="why-write-about-it">
<h2><span class="sectnum">4   </span>Why write about it?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-write-about-it" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>I have already admitted that there are far more resources out there about this subject, then why am I writing again about it? I am not going to lie, the math behind building AI models is ridiculous and dense. The resources (books or videos) are scattered all over the internet and presume some prior knowledge which I feel is overkill. But, we need to start somewhere, right? So why not here? I would also like to provide a reference to <a class="reference external" href="https://nhigham.com">Prof. Nicholas Higham</a>’s 1998 book, “Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences”. In the very first line of the book, he says, “<em>Writing helps you to learn</em>” and I truly believe it. He points to an explanation by author Sheridan Baker. He says,</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>In writing, you clarify your own thoughts and strengthen your conviction. Indeed, you grasp your thoughts for the first time. Writing is a way of thinking. Writing creates thought and generates your ability to think, discover thoughts you hardly knew you had, and come to know what you know. You learn as you write.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since this project is hosted on GitHub if you find any discrepancy in my explanations or if you have better examples to share, feel free to raise a pull request at <a class="github reference external" href="https://github.com/xames3/learn/compare">xames3/learn</a> and I will have it merged. This way, we all can learn from each other.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> When I started my career in AI a couple of years ago I used to get fascinated with the tutorials and the blog posts I used to see on the internet. Without skipping a beat, I would jump onto my computer and try it out. It used to feel amazing initially but later when I used to make changes for my use case, it wouldn’t work as expected. I could not understand what was I doing wrong. I had no clue about the model <span class="raw-html">&mdash;</span> how it was trained, its parameters and the tuning mechanism. Eventually, I used to give up. A few years later, when I started interviewing candidates for ML Engineer positions at work, I used to always ask them how they started their path in AI and ML. To my surprise, they all started just like me! They were also hyped initially but eventually left their project unfinished because they could not understand what was going wrong with their approach. This is another reason why I want to share my experiences on how I got around this problem.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
<h2><span class="sectnum">5   </span>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Re-learning high school-level math in depth may seem boring but as we keep doing it repeatedly, it will become a good habit and help later in solving more complicated problems. Thus, through L.E.A.R.N I invite you to embark on an enlightening journey with me where I hope to untie the knots of mathematical formulae behind AI engagingly. This website is essentially a collection of my experiences working on this subject and the lessons learned over the years. Briefly speaking, I will be discussing a variety of topics from math, science, ethics and philosophy. Through these discussions, readers will be able to think deeply about the essence of this modern technology and the future of humanity. Together, we embark on a voyage that reveals the intricate reasonings behind AI, unveiling the beauty and brilliance that drives this transformative field.</p>
<p>If you read it completely, I would like to thank you for your time!</p>
