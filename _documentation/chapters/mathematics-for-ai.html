<p id="readingTime">0 mins read</p></div><p>In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, be it in its entirety or dissected
into components such as Machine Learning, there exists a profound reliance on
the tools borrowed from the world of mathematics. My journey into
understanding Machine Learning and the broader realms of AI taught me that the
mastery of mathematical principles is not just beneficial, but essential.
Thus, as I pen this chapter, I aim to demystify the common mathematical
notations and emphasize their pivotal roles in the AI domain. This segment,
at its heart, embodies the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">notation</span></code> aspect of L.E.A.R.N, designed to lay
a foundational bedrock for those who, like me at the outset, may find
themselves at the threshold of this vast knowledge domain without a map.</p>
<section id="introduction">
<h2><span class="sectnum">1   </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>I feel mathematics emerges not merely as a tool of inquiry or some kind of
science but as the very dialect through which the universe reveals its
secrets. While pursuing my graduate degree, one of my favorite college
professors, Dr. Schaefer once said…</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>Mathematics is a universal language.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The above assertion by Dr. Schaefer, speaks truth far beyond the mere symbolic
representation of numbers and equations. It is an acknowledgment of the
fundamental role mathematics plays in bridging various disciplines, cultures,
and even realms of thought. Apologies for being so philosophical, but from the
intricate dance of celestial bodies, charted by astronomers, to the quarks and
leptons that play hide and seek within the infamous quantum realm, mathematics
offers a dictionary of precision and clarity. It is a language devoid of
ambiguity, where each theorem, each equation, carries a meaning that is not
altered by the nuances of human language. In this way, mathematics becomes the
common ground on which scientists, engineers, and philosophers stand, enabling
a dialogue that transcends linguistic and geographical boundaries.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> Yet, to say that mathematics is a universal language does not merely
point to its role as a facilitator of communication across disciplines. It is
also to recognize the innate human capacity to understand and manipulate
abstract concepts, to see patterns in chaos, and to derive meaning from
the seemingly impossible things. This language, with its numbers and symbols,
speaks to a shared human experience, an underlying harmony that courses
through the fabric of reality. As I go deeper into the realms of Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning, I find this language ever more crucial. AI,
in its essence, is an embodiment of human ingenuity, a mirror reflecting our
desire to decode the complexity of our world. Through these mathematical
models and algorithms, we teach machines to learn, to perceive, and to make
decisions. Mathematics, in this context, is not just a tool but a bridge
between human intelligence and artificial cognition, a means through which we
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspire</span></code> machines with the ability to understand and interact with the
world.</p>

<h3><span class="sectnum">2.1   </span>Crafting the Vernacular of the Cosmos<a class="headerlink" href="#crafting-the-vernacular-of-the-cosmos" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the rich tapestry of human knowledge and endeavor, mathematics stands as a
beacon of clarity and precision. It is through this lens that I wish to
explore the profound assertion…</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>We use signs and symbols to speak the language of maths and Artificial
Intelligence knows only this language.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This statement not only highlights the intrinsic role of mathematics in the
realm of Artificial Intelligence but also underscores the universal medium
through which we communicate complex ideas and innovations. Mathematics, with
its elegant array of signs and symbols, serves as humanity’s most refined tool
for articulating the nuances of the universe. These symbols, steeped in
centuries of human thought and discovery, are the alphabets of a language that
knows no borders, a language that whispers the secrets of infinity and the
microscopic intricacies of the quantum world alike. Each symbol, each sign,
carries within it a world of meaning, a distilled essence of human
understanding that transcends cultural and linguistic divides. In the sphere
of Artificial Intelligence, this language finds its most ardent disciple. AI,
in its myriad forms <span class="raw-html">&mdash;</span> from neural networks that mimic the neural pathways
of the human brain to algorithms that sift through data with unerring
accuracy <span class="raw-html">&mdash;</span> relies wholly on the language of mathematics. It is through
this language that we instruct machines, encode algorithms, and define the
very parameters of AI’s learning and functioning. The precision of mathematics
allows for the creation of AI systems that can learn from data, identify
patterns, and make decisions with a level of accuracy that often surpasses
human capability.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-symbols-to-sentience">
<h3><span class="sectnum">2.2   </span>From Symbols to Sentience<a class="headerlink" href="#from-symbols-to-sentience" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The journey of AI, from its early stages to its current state of flourishing
quasi-sentience, is a testament to the power of mathematical language. We use
mathematics to breathe life into machines, to endow them with the ability to
learn, to reason, and to interact with their environment in ways that were
once the sole purview of living beings. This process, intricate and complex,
is facilitated entirely through the use of signs and symbols that comprise the
language of mathematics. It is as if we are imparting a piece of the universal
consciousness to these machines, teaching them to understand the world through
the same numerical and geometrical constructs that have enabled humanity to
reach the stars.</p>
    <div class="learn-tweet">

        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>In this context, AI becomes the ultimate translator of mathematical thought
into action. It is a manifestation of the idea that through mathematics, we
can not only comprehend the universe but also manipulate it, creating entities
that can operate within the same logical frameworks that govern everything
from the orbits of planets to the functioning of ecosystems. AI’s mastery of
this language allows it to perform tasks with precision and efficiency that
mimic and often exceed human capabilities. Whether it’s analyzing vast
datasets to uncover patterns invisible to the human eye or driving vehicles
with a level of precision and safety that humans struggle to achieve, AI
demonstrates the practical power of mathematics as a language.</p>
<p><span class="raw-html">&emsp;</span> In reflecting on my above phrase about signs and symbols, we see a
profound truth about the nature of intelligence <span class="raw-html">&mdash;</span> both human and
artificial. It is a reminder that at the core of all we endeavor to achieve
lies a language that is both ancient and infinitely capable of innovation.
Mathematics, with its signs and symbols, is not just a tool for communication;
it is the very bedrock upon which the foundation of Artificial Intelligence
stands. As we continue to explore and expand the boundaries of what AI can
achieve, we do so by delving ever deeper into the mathematical language that
underpins the fabric of reality, crafting a future where the line between the
created and the creator becomes ever more blurred, united by the universal
language of mathematics.</p>

<p>I hope my above discussions have illuminated the indispensable role of
mathematics in Artificial Intelligence. As we delve deeper, moving from
theoretical foundations to practical applications, it’s crucial to demystify
the mathematical notations and symbols that may seem like distant memories
from our high school classes. It’s a shift from the philosophical to the
practical, a step closer to the very essence of how mathematics intertwines
with AI in the real world.</p>
<section id="the-fundamentals">
<h3><span class="sectnum">3.1   </span>The Fundamentals<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fundamentals" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Our exploration begins with the fundamentals <span class="raw-html">&mdash;</span> numbers. A concept so
basic that even toddlers grasp it in its simplest form. Yet, as we venture
deeper, the complexity unfolds. In the realm of computing and programming,
numbers transform and transcend their everyday appearances. While our digital
companions, the computers, operate within the binary constraints of zeros and

                <p>In mathematics, a complex number is an element of a number system that extends the real numbers with a specific element denoted i, called the imaginary unit,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" target="_blank"

                <p>The Fourier Transform is a tool that breaks a waveform (a function or signal) into an alternate representation, characterized by the sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thefouriertransform.com/" target="_blank"

                <p>All four members of the Fourier transform family (DFT, DTFT, Fourier Transform & Fourier Series) can be carried out with either real numbers or complex numbers,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/dsp-book/dsp_book_Ch31.pdf" target="_blank"

                <p>We want to transfer the signal from the space or time domain to another domain - the frequency domain. In this domain, the signal has two “properties” - magnitude and phase. If we want to get only the signal’s “power” in a specific frequency bin, we indeed only need to take the absolute value of the Fourier transform, which is real. But, the Fourier transform gives the phase of each frequency as well,&nbsp;<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/275115/why-do-fourier-transforms-use-complex-numbers" target="_blank"
