**************************
How am I approaching this?
**************************

In the vast expanse of the internet, one can find a myriad of resources on AI
and Machine Learning. However, through my discussions with numerous
enthusiasts and learners, a very common thread emerges |dash| these resources,
while plentiful, often present complexities and intricacies that can be
daunting to the uninitiated. This realization sparked the creation of L.E.A.R.N
|dash| a simple platform designed not just to add to the information overload
but to transform it into knowledge that empowers. My mission is to guide you
through the labyrinth of AI, illuminating the paths that lead to not just
understanding, but mastery of this cool and revolutionary technology. Building
AI *"correctly"* is a fundamental concept that goes beyond the mere
implementation of algorithms; it delves into the understanding of the
foundational mathematical principles that are the bedrock of AI technology.
The field of AI, which is often perceived as a convoluted maze of mathematical
formulas, is demystified at L.E.A.R.N. Here, we unravel the complexities,
presenting them in a manner that is both comprehensible and engaging. By
dissecting and reconstructing AI models, we offer a unique perspective |dash|
a deep dive into the *"why"* and *"how"* behind the algorithms that are
reshaping our world.

|tab| My approach at L.E.A.R.N is methodical yet intuitive, breaking down
advanced concepts into digestible segments. I don't just teach you to follow
steps; but empower you to grasp the underlying logic, to deconstruct and
reverse-engineer, thereby fostering a significantly deeper comprehension. It's
about nurturing an understanding that transcends the conventional route of
learning AI |dash| making it an enlightening journey rather than a formidable
challenge. With L.E.A.R.N's comprehensive guidance, the journey into the world
of AI becomes not simply accessible, but a voyage of discovery and
empowerment. In addition to its main focus on truly demystifying AI, L.E.A.R.N
also champions the spirit of community and collaboration in the learning
journey. Recognizing that understanding AI is not just an individual pursuit
but a collective endeavor, the platform encourages interaction, discussion,
and the sharing of ideas among its users.

|tab| By fostering a space where learners, enthusiasts, and experts alike can
exchange insights and experiences, L.E.A.R.N aims to cultivate an environment
where learning is not a solitary path, but a shared journey. This
collaborative dimension is integral to the ethos of L.E.A.R.N, where every
question asked and every insight shared becomes a building block in the
collective understanding of AI. It's about creating a vibrant community that
learns from each other, growing together in knowledge and expertise.

|tab| At L.E.A.R.N, my teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that
everyone, regardless of their background, should have the opportunity to
explore and understand AI from the ground up. This approach involves
meticulously explaining each concept as if it's the reader's first encounter
with the subject. Such a methodology might initially seem slow-paced for some,
especially those with prior experience, but it's deliberately structured to
ensure a good grasp of the fundamentals. As the complexity of the topics
gradually increases, you'll find that this foundational knowledge becomes
invaluable. My journey into the realm of AI, transitioning from a background
in software engineering to delving into the intricacies of mathematics, has
been a unique and enlightening experience. Drawing inspiration from my
learning path, I aim to bring a similar transformational experience to my
readers. Influenced by the pedagogical style of my college professor, Dr.
Marcus Schaefer, I plan to infuse L.E.A.R.N with a blend of historical context
and contemporary relevance. Dr. Schaefer had a remarkable ability to bring
mathematical theories to life by linking them to their historical origins and
the great minds behind them. He demonstrated how these age-old concepts and
formulas are not only some academic relics but vital tools for addressing
modern challenges.

|tab| In adopting this teaching style, my goal is to not only educate but to
inspire a sense of wonder and appreciation for the rich history and ongoing
evolution of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. By understanding
the roots and development of key mathematical concepts, learners can gain a
deeper appreciation of their significance and application in the current AI
solutions. L.E.A.R.N is more than just a platform for learning; it's a journey
through the annals of mathematical and technological advancements, bridging
the past with the present, to equip learners with the knowledge and skills to
navigate and contribute to the future of AI. Alongside the foundational and
historical perspectives, a key element of L.E.A.R.N is its emphasis on
practical application. It's one thing to understand AI concepts in theory;
it's another to see them come alive in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the
platform will regularly incorporate case studies, practical exercises, and
real-life examples.

|tab| At L.E.A.R.N, my educational ethos is centered around a multi-faceted approach to problem-solving. I believe in the power of examples |dash| not just one or two, but a multitude, each tailored to illuminate the nuances of the same problem. This methodology is not just about providing solutions; it's about revealing the many paths that can be taken to reach those solutions, thereby deepening the learner's understanding of the subject. In every topic I cover, be it the complex world of Statistics, the intricate patterns of Linear Algebra, or any other mathematical paradigm vital to AI, my approach will be to dissect and explore these subjects with comprehensive rigor. Each module is designed to culminate in experimental learning |dash| where I will manipulate scenarios, alter variables, and change operational orders. These practical exercises are crucial in demonstrating the dynamic nature of AI and mathematical models, showing learners how slight changes can lead to different outcomes. It's a hands-on approach that not only cements theoretical knowledge but also prepares learners for the unpredictable nature of real-world problem-solving.

|tab| I am taking a unique approach to explaining each concept from scratch, assuming no prior knowledge from the readers whatsoever. For some of you, it may feel too easy and incredibly slow-paced but the complexity of the topic will escalate quickly before you even know it. Although I have taught software engineering to students and developers I have not ventured into mathematics so it is a new experience for me. I am going to use the teaching style of one of my college professors, Dr Marcus Schaefer whom I deeply admire. I find his teaching approach to be quite simple and rather very effective. He would give us a historical context about the mathematician or the philosopher who established the formula or concept respectively. Later he would make remarks on how we use their work for solving complicated problems in our day-to-day life. During classes, I used to find it very fascinating how something so old is still very relevant today and that is what we need to understand.

|tab| I will use a lot of examples to solve the same problem. The goal here is to build a strong understanding of the subject. At the end of each topic, we will experiment with different scenarios like :abbr:`conjugation (changing signs)`, changing the order of operation, etc. This will allow us to understand how the variables behave under different circumstances. Whether it is Statistics, Linear Algebra, or another mathematical :abbr:`paradigm (concept)`, I will dissect it comprehensively. I will prioritise developing a profound understanding of the mathematical and scientific principles which govern these models. I believe that once someone grasps the essence of mathematical techniques, they can then apply their knowledge to real-world problems with confidence.

|tab| Here, I will not only present the mathematical explanations but the respective `Python <python website_>`_ code for implementation. This hands-on approach ensures the readers experiment with the concepts they acquire, fostering a deeper grasp of mathematics using computer science. Currently, I am pursuing my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at DePaul University. While being here, I have come across a lot of amazing students from different majors and staff members who have contrasting opinions about AI. In the spirit of transparency and objectivity, I will highlight anecdotes from these individuals who hold different perspectives on technology than the rest of us. I believe my commitment to being utterly unbiased about my field of research encourages me to hone a holistic learning experience, addressing the potential challenges AI can present if not handled responsibly.

*******************
Why write about it?
*******************

I have already admitted that there are far more resources out there about this subject, then why am I writing again about it? I am not going to lie, the math behind building AI models is ridiculous and dense. The resources (books or videos) are scattered all over the internet and presume some prior knowledge which I feel is overkill. But, we need to start somewhere, right? So why not here? I would also like to provide a reference to `Prof. Nicholas Higham <nick higham_>`_'s 1998 book, "Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences". In the very first line of the book, he says, "*Writing helps you to learn*" and I truly believe it. He points to an explanation by author Sheridan Baker. He says,

.. epigraph:: 

    In writing, you clarify your own thoughts and strengthen your conviction. Indeed, you grasp your thoughts for the first time. Writing is a way of thinking. Writing creates thought and generates your ability to think, discover thoughts you hardly knew you had, and come to know what you know. You learn as you write. 

Since this project is hosted on GitHub if you find any discrepancy in my explanations or if you have better examples to share, feel free to raise a pull request at https://github.com/xames3/learn/compare and I will have it merged. This way, we all can learn from each other.

|tab| When I started my career in AI a couple of years ago I used to get fascinated with the tutorials and the blog posts I used to see on the internet. Without skipping a beat, I would jump onto my computer and try it out. It used to feel amazing initially but later when I used to make changes for my use case, it wouldn't work as expected. I could not understand what was I doing wrong. I had no clue about the model |dash| how it was trained, its parameters and the tuning mechanism. Eventually, I used to give up. A few years later, when I started interviewing candidates for ML Engineer positions at work, I used to always ask them how they started their path in AI and ML. To my surprise, they all started just like me! They were also hyped initially but eventually left their project unfinished because they could not understand what was going wrong with their approach. This is another reason why I want to share my experiences on how I got around this problem.

**********
Conclusion
**********

Re-learning high school-level math in depth may seem boring but as we keep doing it repeatedly, it will become a good habit and help later in solving more complicated problems. Thus, through L.E.A.R.N I invite you to embark on an enlightening journey with me where I hope to untie the knots of mathematical formulae behind AI engagingly. This website is essentially a collection of my experiences working on this subject and the lessons learned over the years. Briefly speaking, I will be discussing a variety of topics from math, science, ethics and philosophy. Through these discussions, readers will be able to think deeply about the essence of this modern technology and the future of humanity. Together, we embark on a voyage that reveals the intricate reasonings behind AI, unveiling the beauty and brilliance that drives this transformative field.
